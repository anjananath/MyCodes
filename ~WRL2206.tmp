Laravel

In this Code I have included a Controller, View and a Model page. It was part of the project called ‘Bookmyconsult’. The project is a web application developed in Laravel framework. It is used for doctors and patients to communicate and for scheduling appointments. The part which I have included consists of ‘Doctor Controller’, ‘Doctor Question Answer’ view page & the ‘Doctor model’ page.

API

In this API code I have included the code which calls the API resource file "updateUserDetails.php" which in return processes the data in the server.
